"A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?",R-loops,Ribosome,"Judgment: Incorrect
Feedback: The proposed therapy targets pre-mRNA splicing. Consider the cellular machinery directly involved in that process, and which structures are not relevant to RNA processing.",Spliceosomes.,"Final Judgment: Incorrect
Explanation: Spliceosomes *are* involved in the proposed therapy. The Morpholino is designed to prevent spliceosome binding. The correct answer is R-loops, which are DNA-RNA hybrids not directly involved in splicing."

Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?",R-loops,Cytoskeleton,"Judgment: Incorrect
Feedback: The question asks which structure is *not* directly involved in the mechanism of the Morpholino therapy. Consider the primary function of a Morpholino and how it affects splicing. Would the cytoskeleton be a direct target or participant in this process?",Cytoskeleton,"Final Judgment: Incorrect
Explanation: The answer remains incorrect. The cytoskeleton is not directly involved in the mechanism of Morpholino-mediated exon skipping. The correct answer is R-loops."
"In autumn, tree leaves get colourful and drop down in a process called “autumn foliage”. Chlorophylls degrade into colourless tetrapyrroles, while the hidden pigments, including carotenoids, become revealed. Carotenoids are yellow, orange, and red pigments which absorb light energy for photosynthesis and provide protection for photosystems. The precursor compound of carotenoids is geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). 

Which metabolic pathway is not directly connected with GGPP in higher plants?",myxol biosynthesis,Fatty acid biosynthesis,"Judgment: Incorrect
Feedback: While GGPP is a precursor for several important isoprenoids, consider which pathways are most directly linked to isoprenoid metabolism in plants. Fatty acid biosynthesis occurs through a separate and distinct pathway.",MEP pathway,"Final Judgment: Incorrect
Explanation: The MEP pathway produces isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), which are direct precursors to GGPP. Therefore, the MEP pathway *is* directly connected. Myxol biosynthesis is bacterial and not directly connected to plant GGPP metabolism."
"If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. 
Indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.
",18,12,"Judgment: Incorrect
Feedback: The answer is incorrect. Re-evaluate the information provided in the problem, particularly the conditions under which substance Z is formed and its properties. Consider the disproportionation reaction and the information about the hydrogen content in Z to deduce the structures of the compounds in mixtures X and Y. Pay close attention to the non-existence of conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of compounds of mixture X. Finally, recount the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.",4,"Final Judgment: Incorrect
Explanation: The correct answer is 18, not 4. The provided answer is incorrect based on the problem description."
